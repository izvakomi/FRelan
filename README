## FRelan

This is a GitHub repository for R package FRelan. It is still in very active development and may still change radically. The biggest upcoming change is shifting from XML package to xml2. This should give significant gains in performance, which, currently, is a small problem with large corpora (>100.000 tokens in ELAN files).

You can install the package with `devtools` package.

    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    install_github("izvakomi/FRelan")
    library(FRelan)

Please report bugs, weird behaviour and ideas for new features to [Niko Partanen](nikotapiopartanen@gmail.com).
